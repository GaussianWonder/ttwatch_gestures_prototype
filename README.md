# Gestures for TTWatch

* This is just a demonstration of how the gestures on the ttwatch should function.

* This is **NOT** the desired implementation, neither in terms of the **language** used, nor in terms of the **algorithm design**, but rather a *fast way to showcase its functionality*.

> As you could already tell, it is a p5.js sketch you can run in the browser

# Installation

* Download [p5.min.js](https://p5js.org/download/) and place it in the libraries directory.

* Run it through the [processing](https://processing.org/download/) IDE, or just open the html file in the browser

* Play around
